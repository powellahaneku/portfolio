<p>Hello!

My name is Powell Ahaneku, and welcome to my data analytics portfolio!

Within this portfolio, you will find links to my completed data analysis projects, each showcasing a range of analytical skills. From data cleaning and validation and database development to EDA and data visualization, these projects encompass a wide array of data-related tasks.

To complete these projects, I used a variety of tools and software. For database work, I utilized SQL code (PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLAlchemy) to create and analyze databases, as well as to generate reports. Additionally, I used Python to complete tasks involving data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and visualization. I also leveraged Power BI to craft interactive dashboards. I have engaged in numerous web development projects like robofriends etc</p>

<!--Project 2 -->

<h3>2.<a href="https://github.com/powellahaneku/Webscraper/tree/main">Web Scrapping ETL Tool</a></h3>
<code>Javascript</code> <code>Excel</code>
<p> </p>

<p>The JavaScript code functions as a web scraping tool designed to automate the extraction of student data from a specific web interface. It starts by prompting the user to input a list of student IDs and then converts this input into an array format. Upon execution, it initiates a data extraction process for each student ID provided. The core functions within the script interact with the web interface by querying elements to retrieve personal information, service indicators, and academic grades. It compiles this information into a structured format and stores it in local storage to prevent data loss. The script also includes error handling to manage cases where data might be missing or if the web interface's load time varies. Additionally, it offers features like CSV file generation for the collected data and provides an overview of the current data processing status. Overall, the script streamlines the process of gathering comprehensive student information for analysis and record-keeping purposes.
