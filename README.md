<p>Hello!

My name is Powell Ahaneku, and welcome to my data analytics portfolio!

Within this portfolio, you will find links to my completed data analysis projects, each showcasing a range of analytical skills. From data cleaning and validation and database development to EDA and data visualization, these projects encompass a wide array of data-related tasks.

To complete these projects, I used a variety of tools and software. For database work, I utilized SQL code (PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLAlchemy) to create and analyze databases, as well as to generate reports. Additionally, I used Python to complete tasks involving data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and visualization. I also leveraged Power BI to craft interactive dashboards. I have engaged in numerous web development projects like robofriends etc</p>

<!--Project 1 -->

<h3>1.<a href="https://github.com/powellahaneku/datawarehouse/tree/main"> Data Warehousing Solution (Medallion Architecture)</a></h3>
<code>Python</code> <code>Google BigQuery</code> <code>Google Cloud Storage</code> <code>Power BI</code> <code>NYC Open Data APIs</code>
<p> </p>
<p>Our project, 311 Complaint & Collision Analytics, investigates the relationship between New York City’s 311 service complaints and motor vehicle collisions to identify patterns, high-risk areas, and opportunities for improving urban service efficiency and public safety. Utilizing data from NYC Open Data APIs, we built a scalable data pipeline employing Python for extraction and pagination handling, Google BigQuery and Google Cloud Storage for data warehousing, and Power BI for visualization. Our design leverages the Medallion Architecture, which organizes data into three layers—Bronze (raw data ingestion), Silver (cleaned and standardized tables), and Gold (aggregated, analysis-ready data)—ensuring clean separation, data quality, and scalability. We developed a star schema with shared dimension tables linking complaints and collision fact tables, supporting KPIs such as action rates, resolution times, collision trends, and complaint frequencies by borough, precinct, and income level. Our interactive Power BI dashboard enables stakeholders to explore insights in real time, highlighting crucial findings like the higher complaint rates in affluent areas, the elevated vehicle fatalities in low-income neighborhoods, and the influence of complaint proximity to police precincts. This project showcases the transformative power of data architecture and analytics in shaping smarter, safer cities.

<h3>2.<a href="https://github.com/powellahaneku/Webscraper/tree/main">Web Scrapping ETL Tool</a></h3>
<code>Javascript</code> <code>Excel</code>
<p> </p>

<p>The JavaScript code functions as a web scraping tool designed to automate the extraction of student data from a specific web interface. It starts by prompting the user to input a list of student IDs and then converts this input into an array format. Upon execution, it initiates a data extraction process for each student ID provided. The core functions within the script interact with the web interface by querying elements to retrieve personal information, service indicators, and academic grades. It compiles this information into a structured format and stores it in local storage to prevent data loss. The script also includes error handling to manage cases where data might be missing or if the web interface's load time varies. Additionally, it offers features like CSV file generation for the collected data and provides an overview of the current data processing status. Overall, the script streamlines the process of gathering comprehensive student information for analysis and record-keeping purposes.
