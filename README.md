<h1>Data Analytics Portfolio</h1>
Hello!

My name is Powell Ahaneku, and welcome to my data analytics portfolio!

Within this portfolio, you will find links to my completed data analysis projects, each showcasing a range of analytical skills. From data cleaning and validation and database development to EDA and data visualization, these projects encompass a wide array of data-related tasks.

To complete these projects, I used a variety of tools and software. For database work, I utilized SQL code (PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLAlchemy) to create and analyze databases, as well as to generate reports. Additionally, I used Python to complete tasks involving data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and visualization. I also leveraged Power BI to craft interactive dashboards.

<h2>About Me</h2>

I earned a BS in Financial Economics from Medgar Evers College, augmenting my studies with web development extracurriculars.

At City University of New York, as a data analyst, I collaborated with technical data stewards using Collibra, ensuring comprehensive documentation of student data processes to mitigate governance issues.

As an investment data intern in the advertising industry, I employed Excel and Python libraries for predictive analytics, significantly reducing client acquisition costs. I also curated bi-weekly reports, akin to PPC and Web Analytics, to drive data-centric marketing strategies.

Previously, at Wall Street Bound as a finance intern, I delivered extensive presentations on economic impacts and conducted risk analysis in the technology sector, utilizing Excel and Yahoo Finance data.
